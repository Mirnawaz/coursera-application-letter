Why are you applying for Financial Aid:

Hello dear reviewer!
My name is Vlad and I am from Ukraine . As you may know that our country belongs to a very poor countries . An average salary is 285 US dollars per month . Can you imaging living on this money ? But things get even worse when you are a student . Your students has scholarship about 1100 UAH ( which is $ 42 ) . So am I . I can barely feed myself and pay for a dorm . For me it seems impossible to pay for an entire course by myself . My parent neither can help me . I would say the main reason I ' m asking you for the Financial Aid is the circumstances due to which I happened to born in a beautiful country â€“ Ukraine .  Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me a new horizons of the world of Coursera courses , which in turn will help me in future .

How will taking this course help you achieve your carreer goals?
